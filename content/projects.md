Here is a list of projects I maintain or contribute to! Each project link's to
an online git repository which contains the source code and additional
documentation.

- [Bastion](https://github.com/toddgaunt/bastion)

    This is the webserver that runs this website!

- [Wordle Helper](https://github.com/toddgaunt/wordle-helper)

    A command-line utility to assist with solving the [wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) game published by the New York Times

- [Persistent](https://github.com/toddgaunt/persistent)

    A library for Go which implements Clojure's persistent data structures. It
    supports generic types for its data structures when they were introduced in
    Go version 1.18.


- [Dotfiles](https://github.com/toddgaunt/dotfiles)

    My configuration files for software I use. The most configured tool I use
    is [Neovim](https://neovim.io/). It is a fantastic text-editor, and I find
    the support for Lua as a scripting language one of my favorite things about
    it. When compared to Vimscript, writing editor extensions is easier and
    more enjoyable in Lua. Since [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) only supported
    Vimscript when I used it, I never ended up exploring editor extension
    beyond basic configuration.
