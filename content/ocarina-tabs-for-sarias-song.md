A 10 hole ocarina is required for play. The full song is found at the
bottom-left of the page as letters. Each letter in the song corresponds to a
letter above one of the rows of notes. To play the song, follow each grouping
of notes indicated by the letters at the bottom of the page in-order. The black
bars between notes indicate rests, with one bar being one rest, two bars being
two rests, and so on.
