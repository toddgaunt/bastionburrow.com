Links to other websites I enjoy visiting are listed here.

- [volumeelement](https://volumeelement.github.io) is my friend's website about
mathematics, science, physics, computer science, and more!

- [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/) for scholarly articles from Cornell University

- [How Euler Did it](http://eulerarchive.maa.org/hedi/) Really fun series of mathematical articles with a focus on the works of Euler

- [King Arthur Recipes](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes) provides very
  good recipes without all the blog-spam. They are the best online resource when
  you don't have your favorite cookbook on hand. My partner and I have have made a number of baked goods including:
    - Blueberry Pie
    - Apple Pie
    - Chocolate Stout Cake
    - Banana Bread
    - Normal Bread
