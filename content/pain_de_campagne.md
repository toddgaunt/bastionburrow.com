Title: Sourdough

I have been making sourdough for the past month every week with very good
results using a
[recipe](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/pain-de-campagne-country-bread-recipe)
I originally found from the King Arthur flour company's website. This recipe is
very convenient to make each week since the dough requires very little work,
the proofing process is very forgiving, and the sourdough starter can be kept in the fridge week-to-week.

At the beginning of the year I created a new sourdough starter from white wheat flour.
To do this yourself,
all you need to do is get a half-pint mason jar and fill it with equal weights white wheat flour and water.
I usually add 25g of flour and 25g of water at a time,
which produces more than the 40g of starter needed for this recipe.
This process is known as feeding the starter. Now keep this jar out at room temperature,
feeding it every day a small amount of flour and water in equal parts after discarding all but 20g of starter from the previous day.
By the end of 2 weeks the mixture inside the jar should have plenty of bubbles and a pleasant funky aroma.
From this point on the starter can be safely kept inside of the refrigerator and be maintained with only weekly feedings.

Here is a picture of some loaves I've made using my starter and the Pain de Campagne recipe:
