Title: Stoicism of Software

When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the software and processes I
will deal with today will be buggy, broken, undocumented and written in
contexts whose traces have been lost forever. The stakeholders I deal with
today can't tell what is difficult and what is easy. But I have recognized the
beauty of simplicity, and the ugliness of complexity, and have recognized that
the spaghetti code is remarkably like myself. We both share aspects of
the other: time, growth, and neglect. And so none of it can frustrate me, or
give me anxiety. It is simply natural for software to exist in this state, and
we are meant to patch and update it. To feel anger at this, to give up on
maintaining it: this is unnatural.
