Title: Stoicism of Software

When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the software and processes I
will deal with today will be buggy, broken, undocumented and written in
contexts whose traces have been lost forever. The tests I am working with today
can't tell the difference between buggy and functional code. But I have
recognized the beauty of correctness, and the ugliness of complexity, and have
recognized that the spaghetti code is remarkably like myself. We both share
aspects of the other: time, growth, and change. And so none of it can frustrate
me, or give me anxiety. It is simply natural for software to exist in this
state, and we are meant to patch and update it. To feel anger at this, to give
up on maintaining it: this is unnatural.
